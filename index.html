        <h1>The lazy brown fox</h1>
        <p>
            There was a lazy brown fox who lived in a forest. He would spend his days lounging under the shade of a
            tree, doing absolutely nothing. One day, he saw a dog running around, chasing his tail. The fox was amazed
            by the dog's energy and asked him why he was so hyperactive. The dog replied, "I am always ready to play and
            have fun". The fox realized that lazing around was not good for him, so he followed the dog's lead and
            started to be more active. From then on, they became good friends, running and playing together every day.
